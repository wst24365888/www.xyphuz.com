Hello, this is Xyphuz, a Software Developer. I'm currently a student, and I will get my master degree in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in June 2024.

Passionate about using my programming skills to realize my ideas, and also fancinate in learning new technologies in CS field. Have about 3 years experience in writing apps and 1 year in writing webs. But I don't want to constrain myself to just being a front-end developer, I'm working hard to be a full-stack engineer. In addition, I am also interested in the field of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.

'Always have a project on hand' is a good habit I always keep. I often stay awake just to realize the good ideas in my head (in fact, I am too excited to sleep, so I might as well write code). At the time of writing this autobiography, I have accumulated over 1.9 k commits on GitHub in the past year.

As above, doing things with my hands is another characteristic of mine. I will implement even small ideas, such as the registration robot for school events, because after all, the purpose of the program is to make life easier. From my observation, this is something that my classmates around me usually fail to do, and it is the first step that I can't take, but should take.

The quality of the code is the most important point to me. Many of my classmates ignore their projects after they are done because they are troublesome to refactor, or they even think it is unnecessary, leaving a lot of dirty code behind, but I review my own larger projects every once in a while and refactor them. At work, my boss, seeing that I had a good concept of object orientation, let me refactor a code base of over 50k lines as a newcomer, and fixed over 300 bugs during the refactoring process, resulting in a substantial improvement in the stability of the company's applications. I can confidently say that the number of lines of code I have refactored is several times more than the number of lines of code written by most of the students in the department.

I enjoy teamwork, from the teams I was a part of in school to the development teams I work with, as long as they are highly motivated. I have led and participated in various teams in school, and I like to listen to the opinions of students from different disciplines and analyze their perspectives and viewpoints, so that I can gain different thinking patterns and perspectives in different fields.

Finally, I like the feeling of teaching people. I often have students ask me how to write class assignments, and I teach them from 0 to 1 in order to know where they are stuck, and through their questions and answers, I reflect on whether I have limited myself to a certain stereotypical framework while accumulating so much experience.

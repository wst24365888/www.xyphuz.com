In the summer of 2023, I was delighted to be able to join TSMC. As an intern, I made significant contributions to the company. I actively participated in the development of the multi-platform application called Paperless, and this innovative solution is poised to bring substantial benefits. By digitizing complex paper-based processes, we anticipate saving approximately 72,400 sheets of A4 paper annually, which not only contributes to resource conservation but also reduces carbon emissions by 5.4 metric tons, showcasing our commitment to environmental sustainability.

During my internship, I collaborated closely with a partner, actively contributing to the development process. Our team, including myself as an intern, was responsible for crafting all the backend API endpoints and implementing half of the app's frontend functionalities, ensuring the successful creation of a comprehensive and robust solution. More than 160 commits were made to the project during my internship.

Beside Paperless, I identified and resolved 43 previously unnoticed nullish bugs in the original Flutter project template. To enhance compatibility and performance, I created a new version of the template with sound null safety, specifically tailored for TSMC. These contributions highlight my role as an intern in supporting the company's success and innovation.

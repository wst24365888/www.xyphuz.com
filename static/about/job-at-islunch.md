In my junior year, I got up the courage to pitch to various software companies that use Flutter as their development framework, and was lucky enough to join ISLUNCH, a start-up company in Silicon Valley. I am responsible for developing various end-to-end features using Flutter, such as Authentication & Authorization, Phone Verification with OTP, Ever Green Events, Event Coupons, User Location Service, Store Map, Customer-Side Order Stream, Merchant-Side Order Stream, Feedback Section, Chat Room...etc., even for larger scale projects. I also developed the Stripe Payment Service Integration, POS System Integration, and so on, which require reading a lot of documents.

In addition, because our service architecture is Serverless, i.e. FaaS, I have written a lot of Node.js functions in my company, not only the back-end implementation of the above functions, but also various webhook endpoints written to integrate various services. I even refactored the whole thing with TypeScript.

After working for a while, my boss let me refactor a code base of more than 50 k lines as a newcomer because of my stable, fast and high quality output, and my good knowledge of object-oriented programming. In just two weeks, I found more than 300 bugs and fixed them. I believe that in addition to improving the stability of our app, this will also make future development and maintenance easier. After this, my boss also gave me a promotion, giving me a new title: Tech Lead.

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) is a Google Developers-supported student developer community program where students from universities and colleges learn and discuss Google-initiated development technologies such as Android, Cloud, Web, and AI/ML on campus.

I was a Core Member in the program, responsible for planning and conducting activities, and Dart/Flutter, one of my favorite programming language/framwork, is a technology developed by Google, so I was the teacher of two classes, leading the members to create simple Flutter App, in addition, I also participated in various GDSC activities from time to time, and I can say that I learned a lot from them.

NCU (National Central University) sits at Taoyuan, so I also participated in the Google Developer Group Taoyuan (GDG Taoyuan), which is a developer community that focuses on Google-related technologies. I have participated in many technology gatherings and have also benefited a lot from listening to people in the industry share how they use Google technologies in their companies.

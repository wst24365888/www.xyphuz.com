NCUGC (National Central University Game Creator) is a game creation and exchange club created by National Central University students.

Here, we communicate, learn, produce, and publish games together, we even form groups to developing various games! I led 11 members from different departments to develop a 2D RPG game called Paratiti, and I was the game manager. Here, I learned the most about how to manage the progress of the project, how to play the role of a team leader, and how to be the one who is good at communication and coordination in the team. I was invited to give a speech at Tsinghua University during my time as a project manager for Paratiti, and the topic was 'The dilemma and breakthrough of student game development'.

In addition, I led a large team of dozens of people from NCUGC to SITCON (Students' Information Technology Conference) three times, and Pratiti also participated in the Game Star Lighting Program, which is a countrywide event, to exchange with game development partners from all walks of life.

The user interface was developed together with the topic 'Implementing AIOT Aquaculture Farms using Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine'. It allows fishermen to control the switch of the equipment with a few fingers at home, and fishermen can also set the valve value and conditions to make the equipment turn on and off automatically.

Before this, I had no idea about web pages, so I started from the most basic HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, wrote the back-end API Server (using MongoDB for database) with the popular Golang, and used Docker and web server Caddy on my own VPS.

An app written for NCU students to view the announcements of various offices, on which there are various announcements that have been integrated and categorized. The development of this app improved my Flutter and UI/UX skills a lot, and it is also my second product on Google Play. The announcement is crawled using cron with Python and stored to Firebase Firestore. The whole system was served on Heroku.

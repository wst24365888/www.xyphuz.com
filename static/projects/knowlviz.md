Knowlviz is a extension that helps you to build a mindmap according to your browser activities. You can add your own nodes to the mindmap, or just select a node and open new tab, and it will automatically add a new node as a child of the selected node. When you clicked on these nodes later, it will open the corresponding tab.

You can also add notes to the nodes using Markdown syntax, and click on the view button to view the notes.

All the data is stored in your local storage, so you don't have to worry about your privacy.

Use Knowlviz to build your own knowledge base effortlessly!
